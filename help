Outline mode:
Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.
Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,
two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.

Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily
invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end
of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked
back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).
